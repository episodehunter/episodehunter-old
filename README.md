## Episodehunter scrobble

This module is responsible for users watch status on movies and TV episodes.

When a user marks a movie (or TV episode) as watched a client (eg. web, kodi, plex etc.) will 
create a request to the web-API which will redirect the request to this service.
 
To be able to run the code, you will be required to have a basic server (MySql, Redis etc.).
See readme for the API for more info.
